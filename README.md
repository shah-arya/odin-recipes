Current Project is about providing recipes of various vegetarian dishes.
Currently there are only 3 dishes added to it with simple html web page.

We will add many more recipes, dividing them for lunch, dinner and brunch.And then
in categories as breads, curry, single items, and sabzis.
We will create also a ferris wheel as an additional feature for those who can't make up their mind for what to eat.

After the project completion we will have in-depth knowledge and skills of html5, css, javascript, react.js, talwind css, bootstrap5.

        <li>1 Medium Onion</li>
        <li>1 Medium, Red, Ripe Tomato, chopped</li>

        <li>2 tspn Coriander-Cumin Powder </li>
        <li>1 tspn Salt</li>
        <li>1 Tbspn Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 to 2 Cups Boiling Water</li>
        <li>Coriander for Garnishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and slice the Onion by cutting it in half lengthwise, 
            then cutting again crosswise, then slicing. Don't make the slices too thin.</li>
        <li>Peel, wash and cut the Potatoes into chunks about 3 - 4cm big. </li>
        <li>Heat up your pan on medium high (7 on my hob) for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the Oil and let it heat up a bit.</li>
        <li>Add the Mustard Seeds and let them pop. Keep the lid handy!</li>
        <li>Once they start popping, add the Cumin Seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Then add the Onions and Potatoes. Stir.</li>
        <li>Add all the spices and mix them in well. 
            Let this cook covered for 1 - 2 minutes but make sure it doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Mean while, put some water in a kettle to boil.</li>
        <li>Then give the curry a good stir to scrape the fried masala stuck to the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the Tomato Puree and 1 Cup (240ml) of Hot Water and stir this well. Then cover.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to medium low (3 on my hob) and let the curry cook slowly for a good 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, check on the curry to make sure it is not sticking. Stir and add Water if needed.</li>
        <li>Continue Cooking until the potatoes break fairly easily when broken with the spatula.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped Tomatoes and Water if needed.</li>
        <li>Let this cook covered until the Tomatoes are completely softened.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat and garnish with chopped Coriander.</li>
    </ol>

        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>Few chopped coriander leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take ⅓ cup broken rice or any regular rice and ⅓ cup moong dal (husked split mung lentils) in a bowl. 
            Rinse with water a couple of times. Drain the water and keep the broken rice and lentils aside. 
            Also chop the veggies and keep them aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon ghee or oil in a pressure cooker. Add the following garam masala or whole spices:
            <ul>
                <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
                <li>1 small to medium tej patta (Indian bay leaf)</li>
                <li>½ inch cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 cloves</li>
                <li>2 green cardamom</li>
            </ul>
            Saute till the spices crackle and become fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>Then add ⅓ cup chopped onion.</li>
        <li>Saute till the onions turn translucent stirring often.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of ginger garlic paste.</li>
        <li>Stir and saute for a few seconds or till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
        <li>Add ¼ to ⅓ cup chopped tomatoes and 1 to 2 green chilies (chopped).</li>
        <li>Saute for a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Then add 1 to 1.25 cups mixed chopped veggies along with ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon red chili powder
            and a pinch of asafoetida (hing). For a more spicy masala khichdi, add ½ teaspoon red chili powder. Saute for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and moong dal.</li>
        <li>Mix the rice and moong dal with the rest of the ingredients.</li>
        <h4>Cooking Vegetable Khichdi</h4>
        <li>Add 2 cups of water. This much amount of water gives a vegetable khichdi which has a consistency not like a porridge, 
            but not even dry like a Pulao. For a more liquid consistency in the khichdi, you can increase the amount of water to 2.5 to 3 cups.</li>
        <li>Season with salt as per your taste.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook for 14 to 15 minutes or for 7 to 8 whistles. When the pressure falls down on its own, then only remove the lid.</li>
        <li>Serve vegetable khichdi hot drizzled with a teaspoon of ghee, if you prefer. Accompany a side veggie salad, raita, pickle or plain curd by the side. 
            You can also garnish it with a few coriander leaves.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>How to make Gujarati Kadhi</p>
    <p>Gujarati kadhi is a sweet tangy yogurt-based dish made with gram flour, spices, herbs and seasonings. 
        This easy variant of kadhi is made without gram flour fritters (pakoda). It makes for a quick 
        comforting lunch or dinner paired with a side of steamed basmati rice or roti.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the kadhi</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Curd</li>
        <li>2 to 2.5 cups water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons gram flour (besan)</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon ginger-green chili paste or 1 inch ginger and 1 to 2 green chilies crushed in mortar-pestle</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar or jaggery, add more for more sweetness</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
        <li>coriander leaves for garnishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Tempering</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 inch cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 cloves</li>
        <li>8 to 10 curry leaves</li>
        <li>1 generous pinch asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>2 dry red chilies broken and deseeded</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil or ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl mix the gram flour (besan), green chilly-ginger paste, yogurt, sugar and salt with water.</li>
        <li>Beat to a smooth mixture without any lumps.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan heat oil. Keep the heat to low. First add mustard seeds and let them crackle and splutter.</li>
        <li>Then add cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, cloves, curry leaves, broken and deseeded red chilies, fenugreek seeds and asafoetida (hing).
            Fry on a low heat for a minute taking care not to burn the spices.</li>
        <li>Add the yogurt-water mixture which we had prepared earlier. Stir and mix well.</li>
        <li>Give a boil first on medium-low to medium heat. Then simmer for 5 to 7 minutes more or as required on low to medium-low heat. 
            There should be no raw taste of besan.</li>
        <li>Continue to stir in between and often to avoid lumps from getting formed while the kadhi is cooking.</li>
        <li>Once done garnish with chopped coriander. Serve Gujarati kadhi hot or warm with steamed rice or 
            phulka accompanies with a vegetable side dish, pickle and salad.</li>
        <li>Any leftover kadhi can be consumed on the same day.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use good quality besan that is in its shelf life.</li>
        <li>You can use homemade fresh curd or curd that has become sour.</li>
        <li>If you like you can add some pakoda or boondi to it.</li>
        <li>For making vegan Gujarati kadhi use cashew yogurt or almond yogurt but don’t boil the kadhi. 
            Just simmer on low heat till the consistency thickens. Boiling may separate or curdle the plant based yogurt.</li>
        <li>For a gluten free use gluten-free asafoetida or skip adding it.</li>
        <li>You can decrease or increase the amount of sugar or jaggery according to your taste preferences.</li>
    </ul>
